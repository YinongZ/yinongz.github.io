        How to use natural light, shadow, and color converge to create a dynamic shelter for visitors from the city. 
        We believe the interplay of light and darkness is a fundamental factor of how spaces are perceived and utilized. The dim light and shadow help visitors to read the spaces. This principle guides the creation of our interior spaces, where the manipulation of light and shadow is employed to sculpt the tension within the environment.
        
        Our program is an exploration of this tension, a deliberate dance between visibility and obscurity.
        
        Using the light and shadow and the scale of the spaces, we are willing to curate very different atmospheres according to the programs.
